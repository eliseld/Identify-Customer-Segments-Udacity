# Identify-Customer-Segments-Udacity

In this project, part of Udacity Introduction to Machine Learning Nanodegree, we apply unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns. The data that we use has been provided by Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics, and represents a real-life data science task. Because the data is proprietary, we are not including it in this repository.
